<p>This project was done across 48 hours at the University of Miami for <a href="http://uhack.us/">UHack</a> 2013. You can find more info at the <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/uhack-2013/hacks/mia-buzz">HackerLeague page</a> for it. The project netted me a few prizes; a <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/">Sphero</a> robot from <a href="">SendGrid</a> for incorporating their API, a(nother) copy of Halo 4 from Microsoft for incorporating Bing Maps, and oh so close but not quite a cash prize ($300 IIRC) from the <a href="http://www.miamibeachapi.com/">Miami Beach Visitor and Convention Center</a> for incorporating their API.</p>

<p>MIA-Buzz was designed to let event coordinators expand upon the Miami Beach events API by quickly creating webpages that included maps, chat rooms, and RSVP lists as well as generic blog posts. The chat room was designed to be used on mobile devices and was my personal favorite part of the app. Feedback from judges and peers revealed that the Bing Maps integration was well received.</p>

<p>No. Sites made at a hackathon aren't long lasting. I found a couple security flaws upon review- minor ones, really just annoyances. I figured it'd be prudent to take down the active instance. Feel free to download and deploy it locally, though. The folks from Miami Beach API assured me it'd be <em>fine</em> to leave my API key in public view, so feel free to use it.</p>
